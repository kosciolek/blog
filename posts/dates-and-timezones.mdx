At its core, the JavaScript `Date` is just one, and only one number. It's the amount of **milliseconds elapsed since 00:00:00 1 January 1970 UTC+0**, and it may be extracted from the object via `date.getTime()`. This number is always the same, regardless of timezones. A `new Date().getTime()` (or `Date.now()`) called at once on multiple machines, no matter the timezone, returns the same number.

Certain methods (`getHours`, `toDateString` for instance) return timezone-specific data. These offsets however are applied by the methods - the Date object itself is not timezone-specific.
